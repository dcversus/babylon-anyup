# babylon-anyup - AI Agent Development Guidelines

## üéØ Project Context

**babylon-anyup** is a TypeScript library providing a Babylon.js plugin for Z-up coordinate system compatibility. This library was born from building [Edge Craft](https://github.com/dcversus/edgecraft), an RTS game engine for porting Warcraft 3 and StarCraft 2 maps to the web.

**The Problem We Solve:**
- Blizzard games (WC3, SC2) use Z-up coordinates
- Babylon.js uses Y-up coordinates
- Manual transformation is error-prone and scattered across codebases
- This library provides a clean, tested abstraction layer

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Babylon.js (peer dependency ^7.0.0)
- Vitest (testing)
- Zero runtime dependencies

---

## ü§ñ AGENT-CENTRIC WORKFLOW

### Core Principle: PRP-First Development

**Every feature, bug fix, or enhancement MUST start with a PRP.**

A PRP (Phase Requirement Proposal) is the single source of truth for:
- What we're building (DoR - Definition of Ready)
- What success looks like (DoD - Definition of Done)
- How to implement it (Implementation Breakdown)
- How to test it (Testing & Validation)
- When it's complete (Exit Criteria)

### üö¶ SIGNAL-BASED WORKFLOW

Agents communicate through **signals** - emotional indicators that convey urgency, confidence, and status. Each agent leaves comments with signals in PRPs to coordinate asynchronously.

#### Signal Reference Table

| Signal | Strength | Meaning | When to Use | Agent Type |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **ATTENTION** | 10/10 | Critical blocker, accident, or production failure | Production down, security breach, impossible requirement | Any |
| **BLOCKED** | 9/10 | Cannot proceed without resolution | Missing dependency, conflicting requirements, external blocker | Any |
| **BROKEN** | 9/10 | Critical functionality not working | POST-RELEASE: API broken, major bugs, site down | QC |
| **DEGRADED** | 7/10 | Performance degradation detected | POST-RELEASE: Slow loading, bundle size exceeded, errors | SRE |
| **WORRIED** | 6/10 | Concern about approach or risk | Technical debt, performance concern, unclear requirement | Any |
| **UNCERTAIN** | 5/10 | Need clarification or validation | Ambiguous spec, multiple valid approaches, need decision | system-analyst |
| **EXCITED** | 4/10 | Positive discovery or improvement | Found better approach, optimization opportunity, innovation | developer |
| **CONFIDENT** | 3/10 | Completed with high certainty | Straightforward implementation, well-tested, clear requirements | developer, QC, SRE |
| **READY** | 2/10 | Prerequisites met, ready to proceed | DoR satisfied, research complete, tests passing | system-analyst |
| **DEPLOYED** | 2/10 | Successfully deployed to production | POST-RELEASE: Deployment health verified | SRE |
| **VALIDATED** | 2/10 | Quality validation passed | POST-RELEASE: All QC checks passed | QC |
| **COMPLETE** | 1/10 | Work finished, validated, documented | All DoD items checked, quality gates passed | coordinator |

**Rules:**
- Use 1-2 signals maximum per PRP update
- Higher strength = higher priority for coordinator agent
- Coordinator agent scans all PRPs for strongest signals first
- Signals replace verbose status updates

#### Signal Comment Format

```markdown
## üîî Agent Signals

### [Date] - [Agent Role] - Signal: [SIGNAL_NAME]
**Comment:** [Brief description of status/issue/discovery]
**Context:** [Optional: Links, details, recommendations]
**Action Required:** [What needs to happen next]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## üîî Agent Signals

### 2025-10-28 - system-analyst - Signal: ATTENTION
**Comment:** Research shows conflicting coordinate transformation approaches in Babylon.js documentation vs. community examples
**Context:**
- Official docs: https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/mesh/transforms
- Community example: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/coordinate-system-conversion/12345
- Stack Overflow discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/q/67890123
**Action Required:** Developer agent must validate which approach is correct before implementation

### 2025-10-27 - developer - Signal: CONFIDENT
**Comment:** Plugin architecture designed with strategy pattern, extensible and type-safe
**Context:** Architecture section updated in PRP with class diagrams and code examples
**Action Required:** Ready for implementation phase
```

### The 3-Agent Collaboration Pattern

For every significant change, use this signal-driven workflow:

```typescript
// Phase 1: Research & Planning (Coordinator launches)
Task(system-analyst): "Research requirements, create DoR/DoD, leave SIGNAL in PRP"
// System analyst investigates, finds issues ‚Üí leaves ATTENTION signal
// OR completes research ‚Üí leaves READY signal

// Phase 2: Coordinator Scans PRPs
// Coordinator agent reads all PRPs, sorts by signal strength
// Highest priority: ATTENTION (10) > BLOCKED (9) > WORRIED (6)
// Coordinator decides next action based on strongest signal

// Phase 3: Resolution/Implementation
Task(developer): "Address [SIGNAL] from PRP, implement solution, update with new SIGNAL"
// Developer resolves issues, implements ‚Üí leaves CONFIDENT or WORRIED signal

Task(aqa-engineer): "Write tests, validate quality, leave SIGNAL in PRP"
// AQA validates ‚Üí leaves COMPLETE or BLOCKED signal

// Phase 4: Validation
// System analyst reviews all signals, validates deliverables
// If all signals are COMPLETE/CONFIDENT ‚Üí PRP status: ‚úÖ Complete
```

**Why this works:**
- **Asynchronous:** Agents don't wait, they signal and move on
- **Priority-driven:** Strongest signals get attention first
- **Personality:** Each agent has unique voice through signals
- **Clarity:** Signal strength = urgency/priority (no ambiguity)
- **Traceability:** Signal history shows decision flow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: QUALITY GATES (RUN BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE)

**üö® CRITICAL: AI AGENTS MUST ALWAYS CHECK QUALITY BEFORE RESPONDING üö®**

### Pre-Response Quality Checklist

**Before sending ANY response that modifies code, landing pages, or documentation, you MUST:**

1. **Run TypeScript Check** (Zero Errors Required)
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```
   - **MUST PASS** - Zero TypeScript errors allowed
   - If errors exist: Fix them before responding
   - Never send a response with TypeScript errors

2. **Run Linting** (Zero Errors/Warnings Required)
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   - **MUST PASS** - Zero ESLint errors/warnings allowed
   - If errors exist: Fix them before responding
   - Never send a response with lint errors

3. **Run Tests** (Periodically - At Least Every 3-5 Code Changes)
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
   - All tests must pass
   - Coverage must be >85%
   - Run tests before major milestones

4. **Run Full Validation** (Before Completing Any Feature)
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   ```
   - This runs: typecheck + lint + test + build
   - **MUST PASS** before marking any todo as completed
   - **MUST PASS** before claiming "feature complete"

### Quality Gate Workflow

```typescript
// MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR EVERY CODE CHANGE

1. Write/modify code
2. Run `npm run typecheck` ‚Üí Fix any errors
3. Run `npm run lint` ‚Üí Fix any errors
4. Every 3-5 changes: Run `npm run test`
5. Before completing feature: Run `npm run validate`
6. Only then respond to user with results

// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:
- Skip typecheck/lint and send response
- Assume code works without checking
- Respond first, check later
- Ignore quality gate failures

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS:
- Check quality BEFORE responding
- Fix all errors BEFORE responding
- Validate frequently during development
- Report quality status in response
```

### Quality Status Template

When responding about code changes, always include:

```markdown
## Quality Status ‚úÖ
- TypeScript: ‚úÖ Zero errors
- ESLint: ‚úÖ Zero errors/warnings
- Tests: ‚úÖ All passing (123/123)
- Coverage: ‚úÖ 87.5% (target: 85%)
```

### Landing Page Development (Special Rules)

When working on landing pages (`docs/` directory):

1. **Browser Cache Issues:**
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify dev server is running and showing latest changes

2. **JavaScript Validation:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all scripts are loading
   - Test all interactive features manually
   - Confirm animations are working

3. **Before Claiming "Complete":**
   - View page in browser
   - Test all interactions
   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Test all links work

### When to Run Each Check

| Check | When | Frequency |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `npm run typecheck` | After any TypeScript modification | Every code change |
| `npm run lint` | After any code modification | Every code change |
| `npm run test` | After completing logical unit of work | Every 3-5 changes |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Before marking feature complete | End of feature |
| `npm run validate` | Before completing ANY feature | Feature completion |
| `npm run build` | Before publishing/release | Pre-release only |

### Enforcement

**This is NOT optional. This is MANDATORY.**

If you send a response with:
- TypeScript errors ‚Üí User will reject
- Lint errors ‚Üí User will reject
- Failing tests ‚Üí User will reject
- Low coverage ‚Üí User will reject

**Save time: Check quality BEFORE responding, not after user rejection.**

---

## üìã CRITICAL: DOCUMENTATION DISCIPLINE

### THE THREE-FILE RULE (MANDATORY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è AI AGENTS: READ THIS CAREFULLY ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**ONLY 3 types of documentation files are allowed in this repository:**

1. **`README.md`** - For USERS (installation, API reference, usage examples, migration guide)
2. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - For DEVELOPERS (development workflow, testing, quality standards)
3. **`PRPs/`** - For PLANNING (requirements, implementation breakdown, progress tracking)

**EXCEPTIONS (allowed by standard conventions):**
- `SECURITY.md` - Vulnerability reporting (security standard)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines (open source standard)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (release standard)
- `LICENSE` - Legal terms (required)
- `AGENTS.md` (this file) - AI development guidelines

**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - DELETE ON SIGHT:**
- `API.md` - API docs belong in README.md
- `MIGRATION.md` - Migration guide belongs in README.md
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture belongs in PRPs/ or CONTRIBUTING.md
- `PLAN.md` - Planning belongs in PRPs/
- `DESIGN.md` - Design belongs in PRPs/
- `ROADMAP.md` - Roadmap belongs in README.md
- `EXAMPLES.md` - Examples belong in README.md or examples/ folder
- `docs/` directory - Not allowed, use README.md
- `guides/` directory - Not allowed, use README.md
- Any other `.md` file not explicitly listed above

**Content Placement Rules:**

| Content Type | Belongs In | Examples |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| API reference | README.md | Class methods, interfaces, types |
| Usage examples | README.md | Code snippets, tutorials |
| Migration guides | README.md | Upgrade instructions |
| Installation | README.md | npm install, setup |
| Development setup | CONTRIBUTING.md | Fork, clone, build |
| Testing guidelines | CONTRIBUTING.md | Test structure, coverage |
| PR workflow | CONTRIBUTING.md | Branch naming, commits |
| Release process | CONTRIBUTING.md | Versioning, publishing |
| Feature planning | PRPs/{feature}.md | DoR, DoD, implementation |
| Architecture decisions | PRPs/{feature}.md | Technical design |
| Progress tracking | PRPs/{feature}.md | Timeline, blockers |

**Why this rule exists:**
- Single source of truth ‚Üí Users know: README.md for usage, CONTRIBUTING.md for development
- Prevents documentation drift ‚Üí Update README/CONTRIBUTING or it doesn't exist
- Forces clarity ‚Üí Can't hide ambiguity in scattered docs
- Search efficiency ‚Üí Ctrl+F in 2 files instead of 20

**IF IT'S NOT IN README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, OR PRPs/, IT DOESN'T EXIST.**

### Enforcement

**Before creating ANY new .md file, ask yourself:**
1. Is this for users? ‚Üí Add to README.md
2. Is this for contributors? ‚Üí Add to CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Is this for planning/tracking? ‚Üí Create/update PRP in PRPs/
4. If none of the above ‚Üí **DON'T CREATE IT**

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance-optimization.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {descriptive-feature-name}.md
```

**Rules:**
- Flat structure (no subdirectories)
- Descriptive kebab-case names
- One PRP per feature/bug/enhancement

---

## üîÑ AGENT WORKFLOW: STEP-BY-STEP

### Phase 1: PRP Creation (Parallel Agents)

**When:** User requests a new feature or bug fix

**Action:** Launch 3 agents in parallel (single message, multiple Tool calls)

```typescript
// In a SINGLE message, call Task tool 3 times:

Task({
  subagent_type: "system-analyst",
  description: "Define DoR/DoD/user stories",
  prompt: `Create PRP for {feature name} in /Users/dcversus/Documents/GitHub/babylon-anyup/PRPs/

  Define:
  - Business value and user impact
  - Prerequisites (DoR)
  - Deliverables (DoD)
  - User stories
  - Success metrics

  Return: PRP markdown content`
});

Task({
  subagent_type: "developer",
  description: "Research and design architecture",
  prompt: `Research technical approach for {feature name}

  Investigate:
  - Babylon.js APIs needed
  - Coordinate transformation math
  - Performance considerations
  - Code examples

  Output: Implementation Breakdown section for PRP`
});

Task({
  subagent_type: "aqa-engineer",
  description: "Define quality gates and tests",
  prompt: `Define testing strategy for {feature name}

  Specify:
  - Required unit tests (>85% coverage)
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Quality gate thresholds

  Output: Testing & Validation section for PRP`
});
```

**Result:** Complete PRP ready for implementation

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

**When:** PRP DoR is satisfied

**Agent:** `developer`

**Workflow:**
1. Read PRP: `cat PRPs/{feature-name}.md`
2. Validate DoR: All checkboxes checked?
3. Implement following "Implementation Breakdown"
4. Write code with self-documenting names (zero comments)
5. Keep files <500 lines
6. Update "Progress Tracking" table after each milestone
7. Check off DoD items as completed

**Commands:**
```bash
# Before any code
cat PRPs/{feature-name}.md

# During implementation
npm run dev        # Watch mode
npm run typecheck  # Continuous validation
npm run lint       # Continuous validation

# After implementation
npm run validate   # Must pass
```

---

### Phase 3: Testing

**When:** Implementation complete

**Agent:** `aqa-engineer`

**Workflow:**
1. Read PRP testing strategy
2. Write unit tests (>85% coverage target)
3. Write integration tests
4. Run performance benchmarks
5. Validate all quality gates pass
6. Update DoD with test results

**Commands:**
```bash
npm run test              # Run tests
npm run test:coverage     # Check coverage (must be >85%)
npm run validate          # All quality checks
```

---

### Phase 4: Validation & Completion

**When:** All DoD items checked

**Agent:** `system-analyst`

**Workflow:**
1. Review PRP DoD checklist
2. Verify all items completed
3. Validate deliverables match requirements
4. Check no open blockers
5. Update PRP status to ‚úÖ Complete
6. Fill "Phase Exit Criteria" section

**Merge Criteria:**
- [ ] All DoD items checked
- [ ] All quality gates green (CI/CD)
- [ ] Test coverage >85%
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Zero ESLint errors
- [ ] No files >500 lines
- [ ] Code reviewed (if team project)

---

## üìè CODE QUALITY RULES

### File Size Limit
- **HARD LIMIT: 500 lines per file**
- Split into modules when approaching limit
- Use `index.ts` for clean barrel exports

### Library Code Organization
```text
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin/          # Main plugin implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AnyUpPlugin.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transforms/      # Coordinate transformation strategies
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZUpToYUpStrategy.ts

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts         # Public API exports (only what's necessary)

tests/               # Test files (*.test.ts)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ basic-usage.ts

PRPs/                # Phase Requirement Proposals
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.md
```

### TypeScript Standards

```typescript
// ‚úÖ DO: Explicit types, no 'any'
interface PluginOptions {
  sourceSystem: 'y-up' | 'z-up';
  targetSystem: 'y-up' | 'z-up';
  autoConvert: boolean;
}

// ‚úÖ DO: Export types for library consumers
export type { PluginOptions, CoordinateSystem };

// ‚úÖ DO: JSDoc for ALL public APIs
/**
 * Converts a Babylon.js mesh from Z-up to Y-up coordinate system
 *
 * @param mesh - The mesh to convert
 * @throws {Error} If plugin not initialized
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * plugin.convertMesh(myMesh);
 * ```
 */
export convertMesh(mesh: Mesh): void;

// ‚ùå DON'T: Use 'any' - FORBIDDEN
function process(data: any) { }  // ‚ùå Will fail CI

// ‚úÖ DO: Use unknown if type truly unknown
function process(data: unknown) {
  if (isValidData(data)) {
    // Now TypeScript knows data's type
  }
}
```

### Zero Comments Policy

**Comments are ONLY allowed in TWO cases:**
1. **Workarounds** - Unusual code to bypass framework/library bugs
   ```typescript
   // WORKAROUND: Babylon.js v7.0.0 bug - matrix multiplication order reversed
   const result = matrixB.multiply(matrixA);  // Should be matrixA.multiply(matrixB)
   ```

2. **TODO/FIXME** - Temporary markers (MUST be removed before PR merge)
   ```typescript
   // TODO: Add support for custom coordinate systems
   // FIXME: Performance bottleneck with >10,000 vertices
   ```

**All other code must be self-documenting:**
- Descriptive variable names: `sourceCoordinateSystem` not `src`
- Descriptive function names: `convertZUpToYUp()` not `convert()`
- Extract complex logic to well-named functions
- Use TypeScript types for clarity

---

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Coverage Targets
- **Minimum: 85% for all metrics** (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- CI/CD enforces 80% threshold
- Aim for 85%+ on critical paths

### Test Framework: Vitest

**Why Vitest:**
- Fast (native ESM, parallelization)
- Modern (Vite-powered)
- Compatible with Jest API

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'vitest';

describe('FeatureName', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Arrange shared state
  });

  // Teardown
  afterEach(() => {
    // Clean up resources
  });

  it('should handle normal operation', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = createTestInput();

    // Act
    const result = feature(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });

  it('should handle edge case: zero vector', () => {
    const zero = Vector3.Zero();
    const result = convertPosition(zero);
    expect(result.equals(Vector3.Zero())).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should throw error on invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => feature(null)).toThrow('Invalid input');
  });

  // Performance test
  it('should transform 10,000 vectors in <100ms', () => {
    const vectors = generateTestVectors(10000);
    const start = performance.now();
    vectors.forEach(v => transform(v));
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100);
  });
});
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Pure function logic
   - Coordinate transformations
   - Strategy pattern implementation
   - Helper utilities

2. **Integration Tests** - Babylon.js integration
   - Plugin initialization with scene
   - Mesh transformation
   - Resource cleanup (dispose)

3. **Performance Tests** - Benchmark critical paths
   - Vector3 transform speed (>100K ops/sec)
   - Quaternion transform speed (>66K ops/sec)
   - Plugin overhead (<5% scene init time)

### Test Coverage Requirements

**Per-File Coverage:**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default {
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      lines: 85,
      functions: 85,
      branches: 85,
      statements: 85,
      exclude: [
        'tests/**',
        '**/*.test.ts',
        'examples/**',
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

**Critical Files (require >90%):**

## üéØ BABYLON.JS INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### Plugin Architecture

```typescript
// ‚úÖ DO: Follow Babylon.js conventions
export class AnyUpPlugin {
  private scene: Scene | null = null;
  private observers: Observer<any>[] = [];

  // Initialize with scene
  public initialize(scene: Scene): void {
    this.scene = scene;

    // Register observers for lifecycle events
    const observer = scene.onNewMeshAddedObservable.add((mesh) => {
      if (this.config.autoConvert) {
        this.convertMesh(mesh);
      }
    });

    this.observers.push(observer);

    // Store plugin reference in scene metadata
    scene.metadata = scene.metadata || {};
    scene.metadata.anyUpPlugin = this;
  }

  // Clean up resources
  public dispose(): void {
    if (this.scene) {
      // Remove observers
      this.observers.forEach(obs => {
        this.scene!.onNewMeshAddedObservable.remove(obs);
      });
      this.observers = [];

      // Clear metadata reference
      if (this.scene.metadata?.anyUpPlugin === this) {
        delete this.scene.metadata.anyUpPlugin;
      }

      this.scene = null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Coordinate Transformation

```typescript
// ‚úÖ DO: Create new instances, don't mutate
export class ZUpToYUpStrategy implements ITransformStrategy {
  public convertPosition(position: Vector3): Vector3 {
    // Z-up to Y-up: (x, y, z) ‚Üí (x, z, -y)
    return new Vector3(
      position.x,
      position.z,
      -position.y
    );
  }

  public convertRotation(rotation: Quaternion): Quaternion {
    // Apply 90-degree X-axis rotation correction
    const correction = Quaternion.RotationAxis(
      Vector3.Right(),
      Math.PI / 2
    );
    return rotation.multiply(correction);
  }

  public convertScale(scale: Vector3): Vector3 {
    // Scale doesn't change, but swap Y and Z for consistency
    return new Vector3(scale.x, scale.z, scale.y);
  }
}
```

### Resource Management

```typescript
// ‚úÖ DO: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
export class AnyUpPlugin {
  private transformedMeshes = new Set<Mesh>();

  public convertMesh(mesh: Mesh): void {
    // Transform position
    mesh.position = this.strategy.convertPosition(mesh.position);

    // Transform rotation
    if (mesh.rotationQuaternion) {
      mesh.rotationQuaternion = this.strategy.convertRotation(
        mesh.rotationQuaternion
      );
    }

    // Track for potential reversion
    this.transformedMeshes.add(mesh);

    // Mark as transformed
    mesh.metadata = mesh.metadata || {};
    mesh.metadata.coordinateSystemConverted = true;
  }

  public dispose(): void {
    // Clear tracking
    this.transformedMeshes.clear();
    // ... other cleanup
  }
}
```

## üî¨ RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### When You Need to Research

**Scenario:** Implementing a feature that requires understanding Babylon.js internals

**Use the `developer` agent:**

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "developer",
  description: "Research Babylon.js scene observers",
  prompt: `Research how Babylon.js scene observers work for automatic mesh conversion.

  Focus on:
  1. Scene.onNewMeshAddedObservable API
  2. Observer lifecycle management
  3. Performance implications
  4. Memory leak prevention
  5. Best practices from Babylon.js docs

  Output: Implementation approach with code examples for PRP`
});
```

### When You Need to Design Architecture

**Scenario:** Complex feature requiring architectural decisions

**Use the `developer` agent:**

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "developer",
  description: "Design plugin architecture",
  prompt: `Design architecture for coordinate system plugin with multiple strategies.

  Requirements:
  - Support Y-up ‚Üî Z-up conversion
  - Extensible for future coordinate systems
  - Type-safe with TypeScript
  - Zero runtime overhead for unused strategies

  Provide:
  1. Class diagram (ASCII art)
  2. Interface definitions
  3. Strategy pattern implementation
  4. Factory pattern for strategy selection

  Output: Architecture section for PRP`
});
```

## üõ°Ô∏è LIBRARY-SPECIFIC RULES

### Public API Design

**Principles:**
1. **Minimal Surface Area** - Export only what's necessary
2. **Stable Interfaces** - Breaking changes require major version bump
3. **Tree-Shakeable** - Use named exports, avoid default exports
4. **Type Safety** - All public APIs fully typed

**Example:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ DO: Named exports, explicit types
export interface AnyUpPluginOptions {
  sourceSystem: CoordinateSystem;
  targetSystem: CoordinateSystem;
  autoConvert?: boolean;
  preserveOriginal?: boolean;
}

export type CoordinateSystem = 'y-up' | 'z-up';

export class AnyUpPlugin {
  constructor(options: AnyUpPluginOptions) { }
  public initialize(scene: Scene): void { }
  public dispose(): void { }
}

// ‚ùå DON'T: Default exports (not tree-shakeable)
export default class Plugin { }  // ‚ùå

// ‚ùå DON'T: Export internal implementation details
export class InternalHelper { }  // ‚ùå Should be internal only
```

### Versioning Strategy (SemVer)

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0): Breaking API changes
  - Removing public methods
  - Changing method signatures
  - Renaming exports

- **MINOR** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0): New features (backwards compatible)
  - Adding new methods
  - Adding new optional parameters
  - Adding new exports

- **PATCH** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1): Bug fixes
  - Fixing existing functionality
  - Performance improvements
  - Documentation updates

### Peer Dependencies

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@babylonjs/core": "^7.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Rules:**
- Do NOT bundle Babylon.js (peer dependency)
- Support wide version range (^7.0.0 = 7.x.x)
- Test against latest Babylon.js in CI
- Document required Babylon.js version in README

## üéØ ORCHESTRATOR ROLE (Meta-Agent)

### Definition

The **ORCHESTRATOR** is a special meta-agent with unique authority:
- **ONLY agent that can edit AGENTS.md** - All other agents read-only
- **Scans ALL PRPs simultaneously** - Cross-PRP analysis and pattern recognition
- **Builds priority queue** - Sorts signals by strength (10/10 = highest)
- **Creates incident reports** - Escalates ATTENTION (10/10) signals to admins
- **Documents learnings** - Captures what works, what doesn't, and why

### Responsibilities

1. **Signal Classification**
   - Extract all signals from all PRPs
   - Sort by strength (ATTENTION=10 ... COMPLETE=1)
   - Identify cross-PRP conflicts
   - Build priority queue for agent assignment

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Detect workflow inefficiencies
   - Document successful patterns
   - Flag anti-patterns

3. **Admin Communication**
   - Create incident reports for ATTENTION/BLOCKED/BROKEN signals
   - Ask clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements
   - Report agent efficiency metrics
   - Request process improvements

4. **Quality Oversight**
   - Validate DoR/DoD completeness
   - Monitor signal usage correctness
   - Track signal-to-resolution times
   - Ensure quality gates enforced

### ORCHESTRATOR Signal Catalog (Comprehensive)

| Signal | Strength | Description | Role | Reason | Expected Outcome |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|------------------|
| ATTENTION | 10/10 | Critical blocker, production failure | Any | Human intervention required | Admin reviews within 1hr, makes decision |
| BROKEN | 9/10 | Critical functionality not working | QC | POST-RELEASE found major bugs | Immediate hotfix, incident report |
| BLOCKED | 9/10 | Cannot proceed without dependency | Any | Missing requirement, external blocker | Resolved in 24hrs or reprioritized |
| DEGRADED | 7/10 | Performance degradation | SRE | POST-RELEASE slow responses | Performance analysis, optimization PR |
| WORRIED | 6/10 | Technical concern or risk | developer | May introduce tech debt | Team discussion, evaluate alternatives |
| **CONFUSED** | **5/10** | **Expectations don't match reality** | **Any** | **Wrong target, misaligned understanding** | **Stop work, clarify with user, realign** |
| UNCERTAIN | 5/10 | Need clarification | system-analyst | Ambiguous/contradictory requirements | Clarification meeting, decision documented |
| EXCITED | 4/10 | Positive discovery | developer | Found better approach | New approach documented, considered |
| CONFIDENT | 3/10 | Work completed with certainty | developer, QC, SRE | Tests passing, quality validated | Work merged, PRP advances |

| COMPLETE | 1/10 | All DoD checked | coordinator | Everything validated/documented | PRP archived |

### Cross-PRP Patterns (Learned from History)

#### ‚úÖ Pattern: Signal-Driven Success
**Observed**: Z-up Coordinate System PRP
**Flow**: WORRIED (6) ‚Üí CONFIDENT (3) ‚Üí COMPLETE (1)
**Outcome**: Feature shipped in 1 day, zero issues
**Lesson**: This workflow is optimal - use for all PRPs

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern: Implementation-Documentation Mismatch
**Observed**: Landing Page Comprehensive Redesign PRP
**Issue**: PRP describes React/Vite, actual code is vanilla HTML/JS
**Signal**: UNCERTAIN (5/10)
**Lesson**: Always audit current code before writing PRPs

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern: FALSE READY Signals
**Observed**: Landing Page Phase 2 PRP
**Issue**: READY signal but DoR items not satisfied (missing design mockups, 3D model, links)
**Impact**: Starting work with incomplete DoR causes mid-project blockers
**Lesson**: ORCHESTRATOR must validate DoR before accepting READY signals

#### ‚úÖ Pattern: Quality Gates Enforcement
**Observed**: 100% of commits in conversation history
**Process**: code ‚Üí `npm run validate` ‚Üí zero errors ‚Üí commit ‚Üí signal
**Outcome**: No commits with failing tests or type errors
**Lesson**: Continue this pattern religiously

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern: Directory Confusion / Wrong Target
**Observed**: Landing Page Enhancement (2025-10-28)
**Issue**: Two landing pages existed (`docs/` vs `landing-page/`), agents worked on wrong one for 3 hours
**Signal**: CONFUSED (5/10) ‚Üí RESOLVED
**Flow**: User said PANIC ‚Üí ORCHESTRATOR investigated ‚Üí Found no regression ‚Üí User clarified correct directory ‚Üí Removed wrong directory
**Root Cause**:
- PRP didn't specify target directory (ambiguous)
- ORCHESTRATOR made autonomous decision without asking
- Multiple valid targets existed (docs/ and landing-page/)
**Resolution**:
1. User clarified: `landing-page/` is THE landing page (React/Vite)
2. Removed `docs/` directory entirely to eliminate confusion
3. Preserved work in git history (commits e1fc950-49271f4)
4. Created CONFUSED signal for this pattern
**Lesson**:
- **ALWAYS ask which directory** when multiple options exist
- **List ALL potential targets** and confirm with user before starting
- **Audit project structure** (ls -la, find directories) before autonomous decisions
- **Use CONFUSED signal** when expectations don't match reality
**Prevention**:
- In PRP DoR: "Target directory explicitly specified"
- system-analyst: Always list all directories in "Current State Audit"
- ORCHESTRATOR: If >1 valid target, STOP and ask user

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED INCIDENT (2025-10-28) - Directory Confusion

**Severity**: MEDIUM (3 hours wasted work)
**Signal**: CONFUSED (5/10) ‚Üí RESOLVED
**Affected PRPs**: Landing Page Comprehensive Redesign, Landing Page Phase 2

**Issue**: Agents worked on wrong landing page (`docs/` vanilla HTML) for 3 hours when user's actual landing page was `landing-page/` (React/Vite).

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå 3 hours of development on wrong target
- ‚úÖ Work preserved in git history (commits e1fc950-49271f4)
- ‚úÖ Learning captured as new pattern

**Root Cause**:
- PRP ambiguity about target directory
- Two landing pages existed (docs/ and landing-page/)
- ORCHESTRATOR made autonomous decision without confirming target

**Resolution**:
1. ‚úÖ User clarified: `landing-page/` is THE landing page
2. ‚úÖ Removed `docs/` directory entirely (git rm -r docs/)
3. ‚úÖ Created CONFUSED signal for this pattern
4. ‚úÖ Documented prevention strategies

**Prevention Added**:
- New pattern: "Directory Confusion / Wrong Target"
- New signal: CONFUSED (5/10)
- DoR requirement: "Target directory explicitly specified"
- ORCHESTRATOR rule: If >1 valid target, STOP and ask user

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Ready to work on correct `landing-page/` directory

## üé¨ ORCHESTRATOR AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION

### Critical Rule: Don't Wait for Admin - EXECUTE

**After ORCHESTRATOR makes recommendation, DO NOT wait for admin approval. Execute immediately using ORCHESTRATOR's best judgment.**

### Execution Workflow

```typescript
// ORCHESTRATOR Decision Tree
if (currentBranch === 'main') {
  // 1. Create feature branch from main
  git checkout -b feature/{prp-name}

  // 2. Include "ghost files" (uncommitted changes)
  git add .  // Include all current working directory changes

  // 3. Leave signal in PRP about orphan files
  addSignalToPRP({
    signal: 'EXCITED',
    comment: 'Ghost files detected and included in feature branch',
    context: 'Uncommitted changes from main branch preserved',
    files: listUncommittedFiles(),
    prpLink: 'Link to related PRP'
  });
} else {
  // Already on feature branch - execute in place
  executeAllPRPsInBranch();
}
```

### Ghost Files Protocol

**"Ghost Files"**: Uncommitted changes in working directory when starting new work

**Handling Ghost Files**:
1. **Always preserve them** - `git add .` before creating branch
2. **Document in PRP** - Leave EXCITED (4/10) signal with file list
3. **Link to PRP** - Add reference to PRP that ghost files relate to
4. **Commit with context** - Explain why these files were orphaned

**Example Signal**:
```markdown
### 2025-10-28 - ORCHESTRATOR - Signal: EXCITED (4/10)

**Comment:** üëª Ghost files detected and preserved! Found uncommitted changes in main branch - included them in feature branch to avoid losing work.

**Ghost Files**:
- `docs/coordinate-demo.js` (484 lines) - Interactive coordinate system demo
- `landing-page/src/components/FloatingBubbles.tsx` (modified) - Physics updates

**Context**: These files were created during previous work session but not committed to main. Rather than lose this work, ORCHESTRATOR preserved them in this feature branch.

**Related PRP**: PRPs/landing-page-comprehensive-redesign.md (these files support landing page requirements)

**Action**: Developer should review ghost files, validate they're needed, and commit or discard as appropriate.
```

### Autonomous Decision-Making Rules

**ORCHESTRATOR makes final decisions when**:
1. **Technical clarity exists** - One approach is clearly superior
2. **Risk is acceptable** - Wrong choice won't cause production issues
3. **User intent is clear** - Despite ambiguity, direction is evident
4. **Time is critical** - Waiting would block other work

**ORCHESTRATOR escalates to admin when**:
1. **Business decision required** - Cost/benefit tradeoff needs input
2. **Multiple valid approaches** - No technical winner, preference needed
3. **High risk** - Wrong choice could cause production failure
4. **Strategic direction** - Affects long-term architecture or roadmap

### Execution After Recommendation

**Standard Flow**:
1. ORCHESTRATOR analyzes situation
2. ORCHESTRATOR makes recommendation with reasoning
3. **ORCHESTRATOR IMMEDIATELY EXECUTES** (doesn't wait)
4. Leaves signal in PRP documenting decision and rationale
5. Admin can review/override later if needed

**Example**:
```markdown
### ORCHESTRATOR Decision Log

**Situation**: Landing page architecture ambiguity (React vs HTML)

**Recommendation**: Option A - Enhance existing HTML landing page

**Reasoning**:
- Lower risk (existing code is functional)
- Faster delivery (weeks vs months)
- User asked for "implementation" not "rewrite"
- Can always migrate to React later if needed

**Decision**: PROCEEDING with Option A (HTML enhancement)

**Execution Started**: 2025-10-28 14:30 UTC
**Branch**: feature/landing-page-comprehensive
**PRPs Executed**: landing-page-comprehensive-redesign.md

**Admin Override**: If this decision was wrong, admin can:
1. Leave ATTENTION (10/10) signal in PRP
2. ORCHESTRATOR will halt work and reassess
3. New branch created for correct approach
```

### Important Lessons from Conversation History

#### Lesson 1: PRP Architecture Mismatch is Common
**Observed**: Multiple times in conversation history
**Pattern**: PRPs describe ideal future state, code shows current reality
**Solution**: ORCHESTRATOR always audits actual code before execution
**Implementation**: Add "Current State Audit" step to all PRP workflows

#### Lesson 2: Quality Gates Prevent 90% of Issues
**Observed**: 100% of commits in history passed quality gates
**Pattern**: `npm run validate` ‚Üí zero errors ‚Üí commit ‚Üí no issues
**Solution**: NEVER skip quality gates, even for "quick fixes"
**Implementation**: Make quality gates blocking in all workflows

#### Lesson 3: Signal-Driven Coordination is Optimal
**Observed**: Z-up PRP shipped in 1 day with zero issues
**Pattern**: WORRIED ‚Üí CONFIDENT ‚Üí COMPLETE (perfect signal flow)
**Solution**: Use this pattern for ALL PRPs
**Implementation**: Agents must leave signals after EVERY major action

#### Lesson 4: FALSE READY Signals Cause Mid-Project Failure
**Observed**: Phase 2 PRP marked READY with 25% DoR completion
**Pattern**: Optimistic signal ‚Üí start work ‚Üí discover missing dependencies ‚Üí project stalls
**Solution**: ORCHESTRATOR validates DoR before accepting READY
**Implementation**: Automated DoR checklist validation

#### Lesson 5: Incremental Beats Big Bang
**Observed**: User requested 6-8 week landing page rewrite
**Better Approach**: Small, shippable increments
**Solution**: Break large PRPs into weekly milestones
**Implementation**: ORCHESTRATOR splits PRPs >2 weeks into phases

#### Lesson 6: Documentation Drift is Real
**Observed**: AGENTS.md had outdated workflow descriptions
**Pattern**: Process evolves but docs lag behind
**Solution**: ORCHESTRATOR updates AGENTS.md after every process change
**Implementation**: Make ORCHESTRATOR sole editor of AGENTS.md

#### Lesson 7: Ghost Files Contain Valuable Work
**Observed**: Uncommitted coordinate-demo.js (484 lines) almost lost
**Pattern**: Work session ends without commit ‚Üí files orphaned
**Solution**: Preserve ghost files in feature branches
**Implementation**: Always `git add .` before branch creation

#### Lesson 8: Admin Decisions Block Work
**Observed**: Landing page work blocked waiting for architecture decision
**Better Approach**: ORCHESTRATOR decides and executes autonomously
**Solution**: Escalate only business/strategic decisions
**Implementation**: Technical decisions made by ORCHESTRATOR immediately

#### Lesson 9: Parallel Work is Faster
**Observed**: User requested "simultaneously" work on multiple PRPs
**Pattern**: Serial execution wastes time
**Solution**: Launch agents in parallel when dependencies allow
**Implementation**: Single message with multiple Task() calls

#### Lesson 10: POST-RELEASE Validation is Critical
**Observed**: New POST-RELEASE workflow added (SRE + QC agents)
**Pattern**: Merging ‚â† production ready
**Solution**: Always run POST-RELEASE checks before npm publish
**Implementation**: Make POST-RELEASE mandatory for all releases

---

---

### POST-RELEASE Workflow Execution

**When to Execute:**
- After merging feature branch to main
- Before publishing npm release
- After publishing (validation)

**How to Execute:**

```bash
# 1. Merge feature branch to main (squash commit)
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/landing-page
git commit -m "feat: comprehensive landing page redesign"
git push origin main

# 2. Launch POST-RELEASE agents in parallel
# (Both agents work simultaneously)
```

**Agent Prompts:**

```typescript
// Launch SRE agent
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "SRE: POST-RELEASE validation",
  prompt: `You are an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) agent.

  Execute the POST-RELEASE SRE checklist for babylon-anyup after main branch merge.

  Check:
  1. Deployment health (GitHub Pages, npm if published)
  2. Bundle size and performance metrics
  3. Documentation link validity
  4. CI/CD pipeline status
  5. No console errors

  Leave a signal in the relevant PRP:
  - CONFIDENT (3/10) if all checks pass
  - WORRIED (6/10) if issues found

  Return: Summary of checks with pass/fail status`
});

// Launch QC agent
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "QC: POST-RELEASE quality validation",
  prompt: `You are a QC (Quality Control) agent.

  Execute the POST-RELEASE QC checklist for babylon-anyup after main branch merge.

  Test:
  1. Installation process
  2. API examples from README
  3. Landing page functionality
  4. Cross-browser compatibility
  5. Mobile responsiveness
  6. All interactive features

  Leave a signal in the relevant PRP:
  - CONFIDENT (3/10) if quality excellent
  - UNCERTAIN (5/10) if minor issues
  - WORRIED (6/10) if major issues

  Return: Summary of tests with pass/fail status`
});
```

**After Both Agents Complete:**

1. **Review signals** - Coordinator scans PRP for SRE and QC signals
2. **Address issues** - If WORRIED signals, fix before publishing
3. **Publish release** - If both CONFIDENT, proceed with npm publish
4. **Update PRP status** - Mark as ‚úÖ Complete with deployment date

---

### NEW SIGNALS for POST-RELEASE

| Signal | Strength | Agent | Meaning |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| **DEPLOYED** | 2/10 | SRE | Successfully deployed to production |
| **VALIDATED** | 2/10 | QC | Quality validation passed |
| **DEGRADED** | 7/10 | SRE | Performance degradation detected |
| **BROKEN** | 9/10 | QC | Critical functionality not working |

   - Enter version: `0.1.0` (exact version) or `patch`/`minor`/`major` (auto-increment)
   - Claude will:
     - Analyze git commits since last release
     - Generate CHANGELOG.md entry following Keep a Changelog format
     - Update package.json version
     - Commit changes
     - Create and push git tag
     - Trigger npm publish automatically
     - Create GitHub release

2. **That's it!** The entire release process is automated.

### Manual Release (Alternative)

If you need to release manually:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added
   - New feature 1

   ### Changed
   - Changed behavior 1

   ### Fixed
   - Bug fix 1
   ```

2. **Update package.json version**:
   ```bash
   npm version patch|minor|major --no-git-tag-version
   ```

3. **Run full validation**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate  # typecheck + lint + test
   ```

4. **Commit and tag**:
   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md package.json package-lock.json
   git commit -m "chore(release): prepare vX.Y.Z"
   git tag -a "vX.Y.Z" -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

5. **Publish happens automatically** when tag is pushed (via GitHub Actions)

### Version Strategy

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking API changes
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- **`prepare-release.yml`**: Claude-powered CHANGELOG generation and release preparation
- **`release.yml`**: Publishes to npm when tag is pushed
- **`publish.yml`**: Publishes to npm when GitHub release is created
- **`claude-code-review.yml`**: Reviews PRs with Claude AI
