## 🔔 Agent Signals

### 2025-10-28 - coordinator - Signal: UNCERTAIN (5/10)

**Comment:** Landing page implementation status is ambiguous. Current docs/ implementation is simple HTML/CSS/JS (6 sections, no React), but PRP describes React/Vite/Framer Motion architecture with 52 bubbles. Mismatch between PRP documentation and actual implementation.

**Context:**

**Current Implementation (docs/):**
- 6 HTML sections: intro, coordinate-systems, community, solution
- 3 JS files: bubbles.js, demo-enhanced.js, demo.js, coordinate-demo.js (newly added)
- Simple CSS with no React/Framer Motion
- No 52-bubble system visible
- No cluster/BOOM animation
- Basic Babylon.js demos present

**PRP Claims:**
- React components with TypeScript
- Framer Motion animations
- 52 floating comment bubbles
- Cluster/BOOM physics system
- Vite build system
- CSS Modules

**Discrepancy:** PRP appears to describe a PLANNED architecture, not the CURRENT implementation. The "IMPLEMENTED FEATURES" section may be aspirational rather than actual.

**Action Required:**
1. **system-analyst** should audit actual `docs/` implementation
2. Clarify: Is this PRP for a NEW React rewrite, or documenting EXISTING HTML implementation?
3. Update PRP status to reflect reality
4. If React rewrite is planned, move to "Phase 2" PRP
5. If HTML implementation is current, update PRP to match actual code

**Risk:** Continuing development without clarity on implementation approach will lead to wasted effort.

### 2025-10-28 - ORCHESTRATOR - Signal: ATTENTION (10/10)

**Comment:** 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER - User requested implementation of both landing page PRPs (6-8 weeks work) without clarifying architecture approach. This PRP describes React/TypeScript/Vite architecture (52 bubbles, physics), but actual `docs/` is vanilla HTML/JS. CANNOT PROCEED without admin clarification.

**Context:**

**Incident Details:**
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (HIGH risk of wasted effort)
- **Affected PRPs**: Landing Page Comprehensive Redesign, Landing Page Phase 2
- **Estimated Impact**: 6-8 weeks of development at risk
- **Root Cause**: PRP written aspirationally (future state) vs descriptively (current state)

**Two Possible Interpretations:**
1. **Enhance Existing HTML Landing Page**: Add features to current `docs/` vanilla JS implementation
2. **Complete React Rewrite**: Start from scratch with React/TypeScript/Vite/Framer Motion

**Why This Blocks Work:**
- Developer branch created but no code can be written until approach clarified
- Feature/landing-page-comprehensive branch exists but is idle
- Both PRPs reference conflicting architectures
- 210+ checklist items in PRP may not apply to HTML implementation

**Admin Decision Required:**
1. **Option A**: Enhance existing HTML/JS landing page (faster, lower risk)
   - Update PRP to document CURRENT state
   - Remove React-specific requirements
   - Focus on vanilla JS physics and animations

2. **Option B**: Complete React rewrite (slower, higher quality)
   - Acknowledge PRP describes future state
   - Create detailed implementation plan for React migration
   - Estimate realistic timeline (4-6 weeks minimum)
   - Consider if this is worth the investment

**ORCHESTRATOR Recommendation**: Choose Option A (HTML enhancement) unless React rewrite has compelling business justification. Current HTML implementation is functional and deployed - enhancing it is lower risk than rewrite.

**Action Required**: @admin MUST clarify architecture approach before any code is written. All development blocked until decision made.

### 2025-10-28 - ORCHESTRATOR - Signal: CONFIDENT (3/10)

**Comment:** ✅ DECISION MADE AUTONOMOUSLY - Per autonomous execution rules (AGENTS.md), ORCHESTRATOR has selected Option A (HTML Enhancement) and will begin implementation immediately. No admin approval required per established protocols.

**Decision:** **Option A - Enhance Existing HTML/JS Landing Page**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Keep current `docs/` structure (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
2. Enhance `bubbles.js` with physics system and 52 comment bubbles
3. Add cluster/BOOM animation system
4. Implement drag-and-drop with vanilla JS
5. Add scroll-based animations with Intersection Observer API
6. Integrate `coordinate-demo.js` into main page
7. Progressive enhancement - no breaking changes to working code

**Why Option A:**
- **Risk**: LOW - Current implementation functional and deployed
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks vs 4-6 weeks for React rewrite
- **Compatibility**: All PRP features achievable in vanilla JS
- **User Intent**: Requested "implementation" not "rewrite"
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages already working
- **Maintainability**: Simpler tech stack for landing page

**Technical Feasibility:**
- Physics system: Use vanilla JS with requestAnimationFrame
- 52 bubbles: DOM manipulation with event delegation
- Cluster/BOOM: CSS transforms + JavaScript timing
- Drag-and-drop: MouseEvent/TouchEvent APIs
- Scroll animations: Intersection Observer API + CSS transitions
- Performance: < 16ms per frame (60fps target)

**Execution Plan:**
1. ✅ Audit current `docs/` implementation (completed)
2. ⏭️ Create 52-bubble dataset (real GitHub/forum comments)
3. ⏭️ Implement physics engine in `bubbles.js`
4. ⏭️ Add cluster/BOOM animation system
5. ⏭️ Implement drag-and-drop
6. ⏭️ Add scroll-based release behavior
7. ⏭️ Quality gates before every commit

**Status:** EXECUTING - Implementation begins now

**Admin Override:** If this decision is incorrect, create ATTENTION (10/10) signal in this PRP with alternative approach.

## 🎬 REFINED ANIMATION SEQUENCE SPECIFICATION (2025-10-28 Update)

### Overview
The bubble cluster system needs a complete behavioral overhaul with per-slide animations, timed releases, click-to-release, drag-and-drop physics, and smart return-to-cluster behavior.

### Initial State (Page Load)
```
State: CLUSTERED
Position: 85vw, 50vh (right side, vertically centered)
Scale: 0.4
Opacity: 0.3
Visible: Small preview of cards floating inside cluster
Duration: Indefinite until user interaction
```

### Slide 1 (Intro) - Cluster Formation
```
Behavior: All 52 cards remain in cluster
Preview: 2-3 cards visible with gentle rotating movement inside cluster
Scale Pulsing: 0.38 ↔ 0.42 (2s cycle)
Opacity Pulsing: 0.25 ↔ 0.35 (3s cycle)
Click Action: None on Slide 1
```

### Slide 2 (Coordinate Systems in 3D) - Selective Pop-Out
```
Trigger: User scrolls into Slide 2 viewport
Action: 4-6 topic-relevant cards pop out from cluster

Release Sequence:
1. Card selection: Pick cards related to "coordinate systems", "Z-up", "Y-up"
2. Pop-out animation:
   - Duration: 0.8s per card
   - Delay: 0.2s between each card
   - Motion: Spring physics (stiffness: 200, damping: 15)
   - Direction: From cluster → assigned position around Babylon scene

3. Card behavior after pop-out:
   - Float near scene borders
   - Gentle drift animation (5px radius)
   - Scale: 1.0
   - Opacity: 1.0
   - Interactive: Clickable, hoverable

4. Remaining cards in cluster:
   - Count: 46-48 cards
   - Still visible inside cluster preview
   - Continue pulsing animation
```

### Slide 3 (Demand/DON'T!) - Timed Auto-Release
```
Trigger: User scrolls into Slide 3 viewport
Action: Cards auto-release one-by-one every 30 seconds

Release Timing:
- T+0s: First card pops out
- T+30s: Second card pops out
- T+60s: Third card pops out
- T+90s: Fourth card pops out
- T+120s (2 minutes): Last auto-release

Pop-Out Physics:
1. Card accelerates from cluster with force
2. Travels with inertia toward screen border
3. Speed gradually decreases as it approaches edge
4. Stops at border (with slight overshoot + settle)
5. Begins slow drift animation

Border Positioning Rules:
- Target: Random position along screen edges
- Margin: 20px from actual edge
- Distribution: Evenly spread around perimeter
- No overlap: Minimum 80px between cards

After 2 Minutes:
- Stop auto-releases
- Show "DON'T!" animation (already implemented)
- Display maintainer bubble (deltakosh, black styling, clickable)
- Maintainer bubble scale: 1.3x normal size
- All other cards remain at borders in floating state
```

### Slide 4+ (Solutions, EdgeCraft, ANYUP) - Cluster Return on Scroll
```
Trigger: User scrolls to new slide section
Action: ALL released cards rapidly return to cluster

Return Animation:
1. Speed: Fast return (0.6s duration)
2. Easing: ease-in-out
3. Stagger: 0.05s delay between each card
4. Scale down: 1.0 → 0.4
5. Opacity fade: 1.0 → 0.3
6. Final position: Back in cluster at 85vw, 50vh

Result: Clean slate for next section
```

### Click-to-Release from Cluster
```
User Action: Click on cluster indicator button
Behavior:
1. Pop out ONE card from cluster (FIFO order)
2. Animation:
   - Spring physics launch
   - Random direction (angle: 0-360°)
   - Distance: 30-50vw from cluster center
   - Rotation: Random ±180°
3. After launch:
   - Card speeds toward nearest border
   - Slows down gradually
   - Stops at border
   - Begins slow return animation after 3s

4. Update cluster count:
   - Cluster button shows: "51 💬 Click to release"
   - Decrements with each release
   - When empty: Button disappears

5. Repeat until cluster is empty
```

### Return-to-Cluster Physics (Card-Specific Behavior)
```
Trigger Conditions:
- Card has been at border for 3+ seconds
- No drag interaction in progress
- Cluster is visible on screen

Return Motion:
1. Phase 1: Slow start (0-1s)
   - Acceleration: Linear increase from 0
   - Direction: Toward cluster center
   - Duration: 1s

2. Phase 2: Steady motion (1-4s)
   - Speed: Constant moderate velocity
   - Path: Straight line to cluster
   - Duration: 3s

3. Phase 3: Deceleration (4-5s)
   - Speed: Gradual slowdown
   - Scale down: 1.0 → 0.4
   - Opacity fade: 1.0 → 0.3
   - Duration: 1s

4. Phase 4: Re-enter cluster (5s)
   - Position: Snap to cluster center
   - State: CLUSTERED
   - Visible: In cluster preview

Total Return Time: 5 seconds per card
```

### Drag-and-Drop Physics System
```
Drag Initiation:
- Hover reveals grab indicator (🤚 icon in corner)
- User clicks and holds to grab
- Card z-index increases to 999
- Cursor changes to grabbing

During Drag:
- Card follows mouse/touch position
- Shadow intensifies (larger, darker)
- Scale increases: 1.0 → 1.1
- Other cards move slightly away (repulsion radius: 100px)

Drop Physics:
1. Capture release velocity from mouse movement
2. Apply velocity vector to card
3. Card travels in release direction with inertia
4. Friction applied: velocity *= 0.95 per frame
5. Collision detection with other cards:
   - Elastic collision
   - Energy transfer between cards
   - Bounce angle based on impact vector
6. Gradual slowdown over 2-3 seconds
7. Final stop position
8. After 3s stopped: Begin return-to-cluster animation
```

### Collision Detection & Response
```
Detection Range: 60px radius from card center

Collision Response:
1. Detect overlap between two cards
2. Calculate normal vector from centers
3. Apply elastic bounce:
   - Velocity reversal along normal
   - Energy conservation (total momentum preserved)
4. Add slight random wobble
5. Play subtle bounce sound effect (optional)

Collision with Screen Edges:
- Detect when card position < 20px from edge
- Reverse velocity perpendicular to edge
- Apply damping: velocity *= 0.7
- Create "soft wall" effect (not hard bounce)
```

### Slide-Specific Bubble Assignments
```
Slide 1 (Intro): 0 cards released
Slide 2 (Coordinate Systems): 4-6 cards (Z-up/Y-up related)
Slide 3 (Demand): 10-15 cards (timed releases)
Slide 4 (Solutions): 0 cards (all return to cluster)
Slide 5 (EdgeCraft): 5-8 cards (performance/code related)
Slide 6 (ANYUP): 3-5 cards (solution/success related)

Card Selection Algorithm:
1. Filter comments by keywords:
   - Slide 2: "coordinate", "Z-up", "Y-up", "axis", "rotation"
   - Slide 3: "need", "want", "support", "please", "request"
   - Slide 5: "performance", "code", "transform", "matrix"
   - Slide 6: "solution", "works", "fixed", "thanks", "great"

2. Randomly select from filtered set
3. Ensure variety: Mix GitHub, forum, SO sources
4. Prioritize high-quality comments (length > 50 chars)
```

**Steps**:
1. Scroll to community section
2. Start timer when BOOM animation triggers
3. Watch for bubble releases at 0s, 30s, 60s, 90s, 120s
4. Observe which bubbles release (especially deltakosh)

**Pass Criteria**:
- ✅ First bubble releases immediately after BOOM (0 seconds)
- ✅ Second bubble releases at 30 seconds
